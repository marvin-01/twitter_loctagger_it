# twitter_loctagger_it
 This package allows you to map Italian Twitter users to a specific city or region in Italy.
 
 ## About
 This package is specifically intended to detect, extract, and geocode locations from the 'location' field, which is part of a user's profile. For example, if a user wrote "vivo a Sesto Calende", the algorithm would map this user to *Sesto Calende, Varese, Lombardia, Italia*. Note that the 'location' field can be obtained by using the Twitter API as part of the user information.
